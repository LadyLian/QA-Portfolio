# ✅ Testing Checklist – Restrict Story Visibility

---

1. Verify that the restricted users list is empty by default.

2. Verify that a checkmark appears next to a user when the user is tapped on the "Hide story from" screen.

3. Verify that the restricted users counter increases when a user is selected (a checkmark appears).

4. Verify that the users list on the "Hide story from" screen contains all users the account owner follows.

5. Verify that when a user with a checkmark is tapped again, the checkmark is removed and the user can view stories.
